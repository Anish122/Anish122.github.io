                            <div class="st-content">
                                <p>An intrinsic problem of the overwhelming information on the Internet in Virtual machines is that there may be some cases and events when due to irregularities in VM, low fault tolerance or hardware failure the data is lost. Due to the utmost importance of data, it is imperative to develop a mechanism to migrate data among VMs. In this project we tried to implement Data Migration in Virtual and Cloud environment. The project primarily focused on the need to store user data in a safe and secure way on cloud. The environment exploits open source software and tools.<br/><br/>Technologies Used: Ubuntu 13.04, Xen Hyperviser.</p>

It also features the live scorecard which is implemented with specially designed crawler to crawl latest videos related to these three game across the web. User can now be able to access the updated statistics of current players at one place. This website also feature the upcomming events across all the three games.<br/><br/>Technologies Used: HTML5/CSS3, javascript, Jquery, Php, MySql, Ajax.</p>

                               <p>This music application on android platform is designed such to nullify the headache of everytime approaching the DJ to play a particular song in order to dedicate it to anyone. Through this applicaton user will be capable of requesting one or more song from the DJ from anywhere inside the disco arena. This application connects with DJ server through WiFi. User can also request for list of availabe songs for download from DJ server. This application has an additional feature through which user can chat with other android users who are connected with the DJ server.<br/><br/>Technologies Used:Android SDK, Java, XML, Php.</p>

                                 <p>This project was based on microcontroller & microprocessor. Pheobe'd robo is an automated robot vehicle capable of travelling the land while avoiding any collision. This robot has the capability of finding out moisture in the land. It also has a feature to measure the environment temperature at real time. It is also capable of capturing the picturing at certain intervals to mark the environment change. All the data namely moisture level,temperature and photograph were sent to the server at real time.<br/><br/>Technologies Used: Arduino, Matlab</p>
