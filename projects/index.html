       <h3>Data Migration From Virtual Machine  </h3>
            <div>
                <p>An intrinsic problem of the overwhelming information on the Internet in Virtual machines is that there may be some cases and events when due to irregularities in VM, low fault tolerance or hardware failure the data is lost. Due to the utmost importance of data, it is imperative to develop a mechanism to migrate data among VMs. In this project we tried to implement Data Migration in Virtual and Cloud environment. The project primarily focused on the need to store user data in a safe and secure way on cloud. The environment exploits open source software and tools.<br/><br/>Technologies Used: Ubuntu 13.04, Xen Hyperviser.</p>
